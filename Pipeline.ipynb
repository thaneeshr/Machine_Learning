    "## Introduction\n",
    "Pipelines are a simple way to keep your data preprocessing and modeling code organized. Specifically, a pipeline bundles preprocessing and modeling steps so you can use the whole bundle as if it were a single step.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many data scientists hack together models without pipelines, but pipelines have some important benefits. Those include:\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Cleaner Code:</b> \n",
    "Accounting for data at each step of preprocessing can get messy. With a pipeline, you won't need to manually keep track of your training and validation data at each step.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Fewer Bugs:</b> \n",
    "There are fewer opportunities to misapply a step or forget a preprocessing step.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Easier to Productionize:</b> \n",
    "It can be surprisingly hard to transition a model from a prototype to something deployable at scale. We won't go into the many related concerns here, but pipelines can help.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>More Options for Model Validation:</b> \n",
    "You will see an example in the next tutorial, which covers cross-validation.\n",
    "Example\n",
    "As in the previous tutorial, we will work with the Melbourne Housing dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "We won't focus on the data loading step. Instead, you can imagine you are at a point where you already have the training and validation data in X_train, X_valid, y_train, and y_valid."
